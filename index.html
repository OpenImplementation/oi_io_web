            <h3>About the Project</h3>
            <p>
                Improving the scaling of research-based interventions, and thus the impact of those research dollars, is a national priority, but little is known about overcoming these barriers. Indeed, implementation often falls to school leaders because “packaging, scaling, and marketing interventions are far beyond the skill set of most academic researchers” (National Academies of Sciences et al., 2022). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Open Implementation brings together district and regional leaders, researcher teams, developers, and data scientists to improve the implementation of research-based programs. Our goal is to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve access to research-based programs pooling resources to support implementation</li>
                <li>Support implementation practices for schools and districts</li>
                <li>Collect and share data for ongoing iterative improvements to research-based programs</li>
                <li>Collect structured implementation data across programs to help district and researchers compare results within and across programs and districts</li>
                <li>Use open-source projects and share code at <a href="https://github.com/OpenImplementation">https://github.com/OpenImplementation</a></li>

            <h3>Our Program Development and Research Team</h3>
            <p>
                We work closely with research teams who are using research to improve practice and provide equitable outcomes for students. These teams are critical thought leaders in understanding what good implementation means, how we support it, and what kind of data these research groups need to make ongoing iterative improvements to their programs. Our collaborators include:
