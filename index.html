            <h3>About the Project</h3>
            <p>
                Our project presents a cutting-edge Discussion-Based Learning Platform (DBLP) that revolutionizes educational research and program implementation. With a proven track record in 17 schools, our platform enhances access to research-driven strategies, offering critical data on teaching methods and their challenges. This initiative seeks to refine user experience and data analysis, promoting open-source collaboration and transparency, thereby democratizing education and equipping researchers with tools to elevate instructional quality across the nation.

            <h3>Our Program Development and Research Team</h3>
            <p>
                We work closely with research teams who are using research to improve practice and provide equitable outcomes for students. These teams are critical thought leaders in understanding what good implementation means, how we support it, and what kind of data these research groups need to make ongoing iterative improvements to their programs. Our collaborators include:
