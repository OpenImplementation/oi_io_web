            <p>
                Our project presents a cutting-edge Discussion-Based Learning Platform (DBLP) that revolutionizes educational research and program implementation. With a proven track record in 17 schools, our platform enhances access to research-driven strategies, offering critical data on teaching methods and their challenges. This initiative seeks to refine user experience and data analysis, promoting open-source collaboration and transparency, thereby democratizing education and equipping researchers with tools to elevate instructional quality across the nation.
